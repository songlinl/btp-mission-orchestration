## Set Up Object Store

> Several object repositories can be used for storing and retrieving data. In this mission, we will use the **Object Store on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)** as the primary repository. However, you can also integrate with alternative repositories such as **AWS S3**, **Microsoft SharePoint**, or [other compatible storage solutions](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/grounding-035c455a5a424697b60f4a24b6d791fe), depending on your system landscape and development preferences. 

1. Navigate to your global account and ensure the **Object Store** with '**standard**' plan is assigned to the subaccount.

## Upload Grounding Data to Object Store

1. Download and install [**AWS Command Line Interface**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). 

2. Download the [**grounding data**](https://d.dam.sap.com/a/iND4HUy?rc=10&doi=SAP1241295) and extract the files into a local directory.

3. Open the command line interface and configure AWS S3 credentials using the service key details.

    ```
    AWS Configure
    ```

4. Use the `s3 cp` command to copy objects from a local directory. 

    ```
    aws s3 cp <source> <target> [--options]
    ```
    > **s3 cp Example**  
    > The following example copies a local file from your current working directory to the Amazon S3 bucket with the s3 cp command.
    > ```
    > aws s3 cp filename.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket
    > ```
