In SAP AI Core, Orchestration is a managed capability that lets you design, configure, and execute end-to-end AI workflows by chaining together different modules into a single pipeline that can be triggered with one API call.

### Business Benefits
- **Unified Access to Models**
    You can connect to and switch between different large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (from SAP or hyperscaler providers) using a single, consistent APIâ€”no need to rewrite client code.

- **Composable Pipelines**
    Orchestration lets you chain modules like prompt templating, grounding, data masking, content filtering, and translation. The output from one step automatically becomes the input for the next, making workflows reusable and scalable.

- **Built-in Safeguards**
    Features like data masking and content filtering help protect sensitive business information and ensure compliance when working with third-party LLMs.

- **Reusable Deployments**
    You can deploy an orchestration pipeline once and reuse it across different use cases, improving efficiency and reducing development overhead.

- **Low-code / API-first**
    It provides flexibility for both low-code/no-code users (via SAP AI Launchpad) and developers (via API calls), making it easy to integrate into business applications.
